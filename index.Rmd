# Preface {-}

This is a solution guide to the exercises in

Garret Grolemund.

This guide is a work in progress, and all are welcome to contribute. The 
complete source for this book is available on

to contribute are available in the README.

## Acknowledgements {-}

A couple different resources were consulted at various points in drafting this 
solution set (usually to double-check an answer when the question was somewhat 
ambiguous). Full credit and thanks go to the following guides, which are great 
resources if you would like a different take on a question:
